## What is Machine Learning?

"**Machine learning** (**ML**) is the study of computer algorithms that can improve automatically through experience and by the use of data" by [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning).

At its simplest level, given an input $X$ and a target $Y$, machine learning is a technique to find a function $f$ such that
$$
f(X) \approx Y
$$

## Different types of Machine Learning's works (function)

**- Regression**: Output a scalar / vector, which represents values.

**- Classification**: Output a one-hot vector, which represents probabilities.  

**- Structure Learning**: Output a matrix / sequence / graph / tree ...
