1. They study the inverse RG of spin models based on the super-resolution (SR).
2. Instead of spin configuration, they consider improved correlation configuration and propose a block-cluster transformation as an alternative to a block-spin transformation. 
3. For the spin models, we treat the 2D Ising model and the 2D three-state Potts model.
